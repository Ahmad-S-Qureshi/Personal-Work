Hello and welcome to today's lecture
0:07
on explaining the Roman Empire.
0:10
I'm professor Dr. Rob Stephan, and today we're
0:13
going to ask that question of why was the Roman Empire so
0:16
successful for so long?
0:18
What was it about it that made this thing work?
0:21
So we're going to go ahead and start by setting the scene,
0:23
figuring out how we got at this point in time.
0:26
Then we're going to go ahead, recap our story from civil war
0:29
to Roman peace, and then we're going
0:31
to take a look at 10 reasons why the Roman Empire succeeded.
0:34
And then we'll wrap up with some concluding thoughts.
0:37
So let's go ahead and set the scene.
0:39
Our story of course starts long before the city of Rome
0:42
was ever founded when the Italian peninsula was comprised
0:45
of a diversity of tribes, the most powerful and successful
0:48
of which were the Etruscans.
0:51
In 753 BC, Rome was founded by Romulus,
0:55
and for the next 250 years it was ruled
0:57
by a series of seven kings.
0:59
And while they started out really good,
1:01
they ended not so good.
1:03
And that's when Lucius Junius Brutus in 509 BC
1:07
started a rebellion against those kings
1:09
kicking Tarquin the Proud out of Rome
1:12
and starting the Roman Republic.
1:14
In the prevailing ideology of the Roman
1:16
Republic is there are no kings in Rome.
1:19
There is always shared power.
1:21
At least two people rule at the highest position
1:23
and they are voted in by the regular people.
1:26
Now it turns out that after 500 years
1:29
that doesn't work out so well, because the people competing
1:32
for those positions and that prestige
1:34
end up using Roman armies to fight other Romans
1:37
and we're embroiled in a series of one hundred years
1:40
worth of civil war.
1:42
Now Octavian is able to come out of that victorious
1:45
and eventually work out an agreement with the Roman Senate
1:48
where he basically restores the public symbolically,
1:51
but practically they give him sole power.
1:54
And that's when we start the era known as the Roman Empire.
1:58
So let's go ahead and take, kind of,
2:00
a slightly more in-depth look at how we get from civil war
2:03
to Roman peace.
2:05
So the Civil Wars start with this conflict between Marius
CIVIL WARS PARTI: MARIUS VS SULLA
2:08
and Sulla, and Marius is the hero
2:10
of the populares, the everyday people,
2:13
while Sulla is the hero of the optimates
2:15
or the senatorial class.
2:17
And so these guys are the first ones
2:19
to take Roman armies and marched on the city of Rome, all right.
2:23
So when Marius gets control, Sulla
2:26
takes his army and marches on the city.
2:27
Marius has to get out.
2:29
And then when Sulla leaves to go fight Mithridates,
2:32
Marius takes his army and marches back
2:33
on the City of Rome.
2:36
And then later on, after defeating Mithridates,
2:38
Sulla marches back on the city of Rome
2:40
and kills like 50,000 supporters of Marius.
2:44
Now even though they kind of have
2:45
these in particular battles, nobody ever really ultimately
2:48
wins.
2:48
And so we see this same conflict played out again decades later
2:52
between Julius Caesar, the hero of the populares and Pompey
2:56
the Great, one of Rome's greatest military heroes.
2:59
And he actually goes back and forth quite a bit.
3:01
He starts out as kind of a pro-Sullen optimate,
3:04
he eventually moves to be one of these pro-propulares leaders
3:07
teaming up with Caesar but then eventually moves back
3:10
towards the senatorial side of things.
3:12
And they end up fighting it out at [? Farceless ?] in 48
CIVIL WARS PART II: CAESAR VS POMPEY
3:15
BC where Caesar's able to win.
3:17
But even with that victory, that doesn't settle anything
3:20
in the long run.
3:21
And so we see this play out again a decade or so later,
3:24
a little less than a decade later between Octavian,
3:27
Caesar's adopted heir, and Marc Anthony, Caesar's main general.
3:33
An after they team up and dispatch the senators
3:35
at the Battle of Philippi in 42, they
3:38
end up fighting each other at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.
3:43
So when they defeat the senators,
3:47
the Second Triumvirate breaks up the Roman world
TRIUMVIRS DIVIDE ROME'S TERRITORY
3:49
into three parts.
3:50
Octavian gets the west, Antony gets the east,
3:54
and Lepidus gets a little bit in North Africa.
3:57
Nobody cares about Lepidus But in this series
4:00
of battles after defeating Lepidus in 36 and Antony in 31,
4:04
Octavian ends up taking sole control of the Roman world.
OCTAVIAN CONTROLS ALL OF ROMAN WORLD
4:08
So now he's got the west and Octavian's got
4:11
the east and Octavia's got North Africa.
4:14
He's got the entire Roman world at this point in time.
4:18
Now Octavian eventually works out
4:20
of that agreement with the Senate given the title of print
4:24
caps the first citizen and Augustus the revered one,
ROMAN WORLD AT THE DEATH OF AUGUSTUS 14 CE
4:28
and so he takes that.
4:29
Augustus makes it part of his name,
4:30
so we'll refer to him as Augustus from here on out.
4:34
And at his death in 14 after ruling for 41 years,
4:37
this is what the Roman Empire looks like.
4:40
After the death of the first empire,
4:42
it's just about as large as it's going to get.
4:45
And we can see it 100 years later now,
4:47
kind of, at its peak, right, and it's more or less the same.
4:51
Again, this is under Augustus.
4:53
This is 100 years later--
4:55
a little bit more territory but really just fighting around
4:58
the edges of empire.
5:01
So let's go ahead now and take a look at 10 reasons
5:04
why the Roman Empire was successful.
5:06
Why does this whole thing work?
5:08
And it's an interesting question to ask, because when we looked
5:11
at Greece and we looked at the Athenian empire
5:14
in the 5th century BC that only lasts for maybe 50 years.
5:19
It's a relatively short period of time.
5:22
Now Greek culture lasts a lot longer than that,
5:24
but their ability to kind of dominate other areas
5:27
is really quite short.
5:29
So Rome ends up going from 27 BC all the way for another 500
5:34
years, and you could even look kind of previously
5:37
to that starting with the Punic wars as, kind of, Rome's
5:40
empire starting back then.
5:41
So it really ends up being quite a long time.
5:44
Now the first reason that Rome, kind of, is so successful,
5:47
right-- this is probably what you were thinking of.
THE ROMAN ARMY
5:49
This is an obvious one--
5:50
the Roman army, right.
5:52
They're really strong.
5:53
They're very well-organized.
5:55
And this deters invasion from the outside,
5:59
and it also deters rebellion from the inside.
6:02
And one of the things that they do when they structure the army
6:05
is when you get soldiers from particular regions,
6:08
the Romans don't let those soldiers
6:11
serve in their home land, OK.
6:14
So if you're a soldier from Britain
6:16
and you join the Roman army, you're
6:18
going to be stationed somewhere other than Britain.
6:20
And what that does is it, kind, of prevents you
6:22
from teaming up with people in that region
6:26
to foment rebellion.
6:28
Now the second reason we're going to look at
EXTERNAL ENEMIES SMALL IN SCALE
6:31
are Rome's external enemies, and they turn out
6:34
to be kind of fairly small in scale.
6:36
Now during the whole Pax Romana, right,
6:38
during the whole Roman Empire, there's
6:40
always fighting around the edge.
6:42
When we say the Roman peace or the Pax Romana,
6:44
it doesn't mean there's no fighting at all.
6:46
It just means things internally are very peaceful.
6:49
There's always still fighting around the edge,
6:51
but it turns out that this doesn't matter a lot.
6:54
Maybe you gain a little bit of land.
6:55
Maybe you lose a little bit of land.
6:58
But the enemies aren't strong enough
7:00
to make any kind of serious impact into Roman cohesion.
7:04
Now how do you rule these areas?
EXTREMELY LIGHT BUREAUCRACY
7:07
Well, one of the reasons Rome's successful
7:09
is that it has a very light bureaucracy.
7:13
And what I mean by that is they're
7:15
able to govern an extremely large area of land
7:19
with a very small number of administrators.
7:23
And so it's something like several hundred administrators
7:27
to govern the entire Roman Empire.
7:30
And that might sound like a lot.
7:31
That's an incredibly small number of administrators
7:34
to govern an area this large.
7:37
You could compare this with something like Hon China.
7:40
So Hon China is an empire around the same time as Rome
7:43
over in the east obviously, and they
7:45
have something like 50 times as many administrators
7:48
as Rome does-- a very different way of doing things.
TRICKLE DOWN ASSIMILIATION
7:52
So if they have this few administrators, right,
7:55
if they have this small number of administrators,
7:57
how does it actually work that they
7:58
can govern such a large area?
8:00
Well, that comes to the fourth reason,
8:02
and that's the strategy of trickle down assimilation,
8:05
all right.
8:06
So if you go all over the Roman world--
8:08
these pictures are from Croatia and you have this fine looking
8:11
professor here in front of these very Roman looking monuments
8:14
in Croatia, right--
8:15
how does it get there?
8:16
How do you rule places like that if you're
8:18
just, kind of, centered on the Italian peninsula?
8:22
Well, what you do is you co-opt local leaders.
8:25
So here we see Vercingetorix, and he obviously
8:28
didn't get co-opted.
8:29
But the idea is you take other Gallic leaders
8:32
and other leaders from Croatia in all
8:34
of these areas around the Roman Empire,
8:37
and you basically incentivize them.
8:39
You flip that guy at the top, and you make it really
8:42
worth their while to convert other people to this,
8:45
kind of, Roman way of living.
8:47
And then you only have to reward one person.
8:49
And in doing so, you don't need to set up your own people
8:52
there.
8:52
You can rely on this person to keep them, kind of, at bay,
8:55
keep them Romanized, that, sort of,
8:57
thing without a lot of people up at the top.
ACCEPTING OF FOREIGN INFLUENCE
9:01
In addition to that, Rome is very
9:03
accepting in general about, kind of,
9:05
religious and cultural influence.
9:08
So they want people to, kind of, be Romanized, right.
9:11
That's useful for them.
9:13
But at the same time, when it comes to religion
9:15
and comes to, kind of, cultural beliefs.
9:17
They're extremely open.
9:18
And with religion especially, they're
9:20
actually willing to bringing gods from abroad.
9:23
So what we're looking at here is Niforos, all right,
9:26
and he's this God from the east.
9:27
Think about almost the old Persian Empire or something
9:30
like that.
9:31
And when the Roman armies go out east, they encounter, kind of,
9:33
this God, and they're like that guy's cool.
9:36
We like what he's doing, what he's bringing to the table
9:39
religiously, and so they bring him back to Rome
9:41
and they set up a cult for him in Rome.
9:44
And Rome is basically fine with this.
9:46
The more gods, the better.
9:48
They have the traditional pantheon.
9:50
But if you like some other god, that's just fine.
9:53
And so that allows them to incorporate
9:55
a huge diversity of people and not upset their core beliefs.
10:00
And as long as they pay taxes and as long as they, kind of,
10:03
worship the Roman Empire as well,
10:06
right, then they're all good.
10:08
And remember it's that last thing that ends up
10:11
getting Christians in trouble--
10:12
their kind of inability or unwillingness
10:15
to worship the emperor because they
10:17
think Jesus is the only person to be worshipped there.
10:21
So the sixth reason-- this is very, very practical, right--
TAXES WERE RELATIVELY LOW KET A GOOD FOR ECONOMYA
10:25
taxes in the Roman Empire were very low.
10:28
Right now think about how much you pay in taxes, right,
10:32
if you know.
10:33
I always ask that question to students,
10:34
and they always think, like, I don't know,
10:36
the answer is 10% or something.
10:37
We pay way more than that in taxes.
10:39
But in the ancient Roman Empire, it was only about 5% to 10%
10:44
of somebody's income that they would end up paying.
10:47
And so you had to pay your taxes,
10:49
but it was a fairly light burden.
10:51
Today we pay 25% or 30% or more of our income in taxes.
10:57
Now taxation also the argument has
10:59
been that it's been good for the economy.
11:01
And the reason for this is what this does
11:03
is when you have to pay somebody in coin,
11:06
you have to go to the market to sell your goods.
11:09
So even if you're a farmer like way
11:11
out growing your crops, growing grain or grapes or olive oil,
11:14
right, you can't just trade that for other stuff you need.
11:17
You have to go to a market.
11:18
You have to sell it there, so that you can get coinage
11:21
so that you can pay your taxes.
11:23
And this basically brings people together in markets
11:26
and facilitates a greater level of exchange.
COMMON CURRENCY
11:30
And this goes along with our seventh reason that Rome's
11:32
successful, a common currency.
11:35
So we saw with Augustus that one of the things he does
11:38
is he links the kind of Roman mint
11:39
with the provincial mint basically making,
11:42
kind of, an empire wide economy.
11:45
And what this does is it allows for really easy commerce
11:49
across huge distances.
11:51
You can go ahead and be an Egyptian dude who sales out
11:54
to France, gives them a bunch of coins
11:56
to buy a bunch of delicious French wine,
11:59
and then sales back to Egypt, and, A,
12:01
you've got ports in both places and, B,
12:04
you can pay with your coinage and they're
12:05
going to know that it's good coinage, all right.
12:08
So it lowers these transaction costs,
12:10
and it facilitates large scale long distance trade.
EXCELLENT INFRASTRUCTURE
12:14
Now one of the other reasons you're able to get from Egypt
12:16
all away to France for your nice delicious wine
12:19
is the wonderful Roman infrastructure,
12:21
reason number eight.
12:23
So Rome is known for its roads, right.
12:25
All the roads lead to Rome, and we can still
12:27
see those in the archaeological record today.
12:30
So this is the Via Appia running out of Rome to Brundisium.
12:34
And once you get, kind of, just outside the city,
12:37
you can walk along this thing.
12:38
It's a really cool experience to walk all along a road that
12:41
was built 2000 years ago.
12:43
And if you're looking closely, you
12:44
can actually still see where the, kind of,
12:46
cart marks are in the original stones, right.
12:49
So where the carts would go, you get
12:50
these kind of divots in the original stones.
12:54
And that along with harbors and ports and that sort of thing
12:58
helps people move themselves and goods quickly and cheaply
13:02
across the empire.
13:03
Now another form of infrastructure
CLEAN WATER
13:05
is reason number nine, and that's the aqueducts.
13:08
The only reason Rome is able to be a city of a million people
13:12
is because they have clean water, all right.
13:16
In the ancient world, you get these large cities
13:18
and they're like hotbeds of disease, all right.
13:21
The only reason that that's, kind of, kept at bay
13:23
is because people had good clean drinking water, and the reason
13:27
they have that is because they build this enormous, kind of,
13:30
amazing system of aqueducts leading from these,
13:33
kind of, mountains where you get runoff, the water runoff,
13:35
and then it's at something like a slope of, like, less than 1%
13:39
over dozens of miles, right.
13:41
It's just sloped just that much, and it ends up in Rome
13:45
and everybody has access to clean water
13:48
to keep them healthy and keep them hydrated.
13:52
And then we turn to reason number 10, right, perhaps
13:54
the biggest reason of all, and we've mentioned
13:56
this a little bit already.
IMPERIAL RULE
13:58
One of the biggest reasons that this ends up working,
14:01
the empire ends up working is because Rome stops fighting
14:05
with each other, right.
14:07
The Senate and the people of Rome
14:08
are able to get behind a single person.
14:12
And so we see that even though the republic had
14:15
some wonderful leaders, people far more
14:18
intelligent than the later Giulio Claudians, right--
14:20
Julius Caesar was brilliant.
14:23
Caligula was crazy, and yet Caligula
14:26
is ruling an empire where everything's
14:27
nice and smooth and peaceful, and Julius Caesar
14:30
ends up assassinated on the Ides of March.
14:32
So people in the Senate's ability
14:34
to get behind a single person is a huge part of what this,
14:38
kind of--
14:38
what makes this peace last, right,
14:41
the kind of general agreement not to fight with each other.
14:45
So let's wrap up with a couple concluding thoughts.
14:49
So we've got all these reasons, right, the Roman army, we've
14:51
got weak external enemies, we've got
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
14:53
this very light bureaucracy, and trickle down assimilation
14:57
that helps convert people over to the Romanized
14:59
way of doing things.
15:00
We've got a culture that's very accepting of other cultures
15:04
religiously and otherwise.
15:06
We've got low taxes, right-- everybody loves that--
15:09
a common currency, which facilitates exchange.
15:12
We've got excellent infrastructure.
15:14
People can move all over the place in the Roman world,
15:17
and they can drink clean water and stay healthy
15:19
in highly urbanized cities.
15:21
And then finally, right, by kind of accepting this, kind of,
15:25
one person as ruler, they stop fighting
15:27
with each other, which allows for this period of peace.
15:31
And this, kind of--
15:32
it raises a question to me, right,
15:34
as I was putting this together.
15:36
I was thinking, which is better?
15:39
Is it better to have the rule of the people
15:41
where people get to vote on kind of meaningful leaders
15:45
like you have in the Republic but have that lead to,
15:48
kind of, chaos, right, civil war,
15:50
or is it better to have that power, kind of,
15:53
taken away, right?
15:54
People aren't meaningfully voting anymore,
15:57
and yet the world is at peace and things
15:59
are going really well.
16:02
So I don't think that there's a particularly right or wrong
16:05
answer to that, but it's an interesting question to ask
16:09
and one that must be asked if you're trying
16:10
to explain the Roman Empire.
16:13
16:15
[SOUND]
16:18
