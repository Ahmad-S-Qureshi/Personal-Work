Hello and welcome to today's lecture
0:07
on the classical legacy.
0:09
I'm your professor, Dr. Rob Stephan.
0:11
And today we are going to look at the impact
0:14
that ancient Greece and ancient Rome
0:16
have had on the contemporary world.
0:18
So we'll go ahead and start by asking the question, why
0:21
study history?
0:23
We'll just touch on a couple of points there.
0:25
And then we'll look at the legacy of Greece, followed
0:27
by the legacy of Rome, and wrap up
0:29
with a few concluding thoughts.
Why Study History
0:32
So why study history?
0:35
Maybe you're asking that question
0:36
right now after you've been through most of the course.
0:39
But let's go ahead.
0:40
One of the issues is that Augustus is not
0:43
going to teach you how to computer program.
0:45
All right?
0:46
And it might be, actually, that learning
0:48
ancient Greek and Latin gives you
0:50
a sense for how different languages fit together.
0:52
So maybe that is useful for programming.
0:54
But Augustus himself is not going
0:55
to come up and start programming JavaScript for you.
0:58
So why do it at all if it's not going to kind of lead directly
1:01
into your programming job?
1:03
Well, the kind of traditional explanation
1:06
is essentially that those who do not study the past
1:09
are doomed to repeat it.
1:11
And people have been saying that in one form
1:13
or another for two millennia.
1:14
All right?
1:15
The quote itself actually comes from, like, the 1800s and that
1:18
was based on a quote from the 1700s.
1:20
And that goes all the way back to Livy, actually.
1:22
Right?
1:23
The guy who wrote the foundation of Rome 2,000 years ago.
1:27
And he basically said the reason that he's
1:29
writing this is because we've got
1:31
all these examples in history of different situations
1:34
and actions that were made based on those situations and then
1:38
the outcomes for how those actions turned out.
1:40
And we can use those to kind decide
1:42
what to do in the modern day.
1:44
So that's one of the main reasons.
1:47
But one of the other reasons is that classical antiquity
1:51
very much shapes the way the world is today, especially
1:55
here in America.
1:56
All right?
1:57
So much of what we have in kind of the most prominent realms
2:01
of our lives-- in terms of politics and economics
2:04
and education and theater and pop culture and everything,
2:09
sports--
2:10
can go back to ancient Greece and Rome.
2:13
So let's go ahead and start with Greece
2:14
and look at some of the ways that it
2:17
has left a legacy for us today.
Democracy
2:20
Now, the number one thing has got to be democracy.
2:23
Right?
2:23
We say that we live in a democracy today.
2:25
And it's ancient Greece, in this kind of time of chaos,
2:28
in between being threatened by Sparta
2:30
and then Persia coming in a few years later.
2:33
They very quickly develop this idea of direct democracy, where
2:39
people are chosen by lot to serve on a committee that
2:42
sets the agenda of what to vote on,
2:45
and then every male citizen can go into a room,
2:47
and they raise their hand or they drop their colored stone
2:50
into a certain basket, and they are directly voting
2:53
on the issues of the day.
2:54
Should we raise taxes?
2:55
Should we put somebody to death?
2:57
Should we go to war with Sparta?
2:59
These people are making those decisions.
3:01
So democracy today is quite a bit different.
3:03
It's actually more like Roman Republicanism.
3:05
We'll talk about that in a second.
3:06
But this idea of giving power to the people
3:09
is one of the most kind of influential aspects
3:12
of ancient Greece.
3:13
We also have philosophy.
3:14
Right?
3:15
So we still ask these kind of core questions today.
3:18
How does the world work?
3:20
Why does it work the way it does?
3:22
And then, how should we behave in the world?
3:24
Right?
3:25
And some of these things end up being the core questions
3:28
that we ask in science.
3:29
Right?
3:29
How does the world work?
3:30
And we have people investigating those
3:32
in a very kind of scientific way,
3:36
for lack of a better term now.
3:37
But we also have philosophers talking about the way
3:40
that we should act in the world.
3:42
Theater and drama.
3:43
Right?
3:43
Now, the form here has changed.
3:45
We still have theater that you can go and watch live people.
3:48
But for the most part, you're going to the movies,
3:50
you're at home watching Netflix, that sort of thing.
3:52
But this idea of kind of tragedy and dramas--
3:55
or comedies-- end up going back to ancient Greece.
3:59
And one of the cool things here is
4:01
this was actually a core part of society.
4:02
And it gave people a way to voice their opinions
4:06
on kind of the way things were going culturally at the time.
4:10
And this especially happened in the Greek world in comedies.
4:13
Right?
4:13
So comedies were used to be able to express
4:16
people's concerns of the day.
4:18
And so for example, during the Peloponnesian War,
4:22
as Athens and Sparta were fighting,
4:24
we get Aristophanes writing plays like the Lysistrata,
4:27
where the women of Athens go on a sex strike from the men
4:30
until they bring an end to the war.
4:32
And it's very much the people saying, hey, why are we
4:34
embroiled in this war?
4:35
It's not good for anybody.
4:37
Now, architecture.
4:38
Right?
4:38
You're looking at the Hephaisteion
4:41
from the Athenian Agora over here.
4:43
And then you're looking at the United States Treasury
4:46
in Washington, DC, over here.
4:48
And man, gee, those look awfully similar.
4:51
Right?
4:52
So neoclassical architecture gets all of its core components
4:55
from the ancient Greek and Roman worlds.
4:58
You can do kind of an architectural analysis,
5:00
figure out the differences here.
5:02
See if you can do it.
5:04
OK.
5:04
Well, one of them.
5:05
Right?
5:06
We've got the Doric order over here
5:07
with these kind of bowl-shaped capitals,
5:09
where we've got the Ionic order over here with the column bases
5:14
and with the scroll volute capitals on top.
5:17
Sports.
5:17
Right?
5:18
Sports-- this idea of kind of friendly competition.
5:21
Athletic competition goes back to ancient Greece.
5:23
We've got statues like the Discobolus.
5:25
We've got the Olympics founded in 776 BC.
5:29
And those lasted for over 1,000 years in antiquity
5:31
before being brought to an end by the emperor Theodosius right
5:35
before 400 CE.
5:37
But in 1896, a guy by the name by the name
5:40
of Pierre de Coubertin ends up bringing this back--
5:45
this idea of the Olympics back.
5:47
And from 1896 until today, we have these every four years
5:51
or, more recently, every two years.
5:55
And that's a tradition, again, that
5:56
goes back over 2,700 years halfway across the world.
6:01
Science and technology.
6:03
Right?
6:03
If you made it to college and you're watching this right now,
6:06
it's probably because you took the SAT.
6:08
And if you took the SAT, I know you busted out the Pythagorean
6:11
theorem.
6:12
And that goes back to our main man here, Pythagoras.
6:15
Right?
6:15
So things like that-- mathematics, the calendar,
6:18
astronomy--
6:20
all have monumental developments in the ancient Greek world.
6:23
Medicine and health care.
6:24
Right?
6:25
If you're going into medicine, one day you
6:27
will take the Hippocratic oath.
6:28
First, do no harm.
6:30
And that's named after our guy over here, Hippocrates of Kos.
6:35
Now, he had his own kind of versions of sayings,
6:37
and they didn't exactly match up to what we call
6:39
the Hippocratic oath today.
6:41
But he did kind of actually practice that idea of first,
6:44
do no harm.
6:45
Actually, a lot of what he did was just
6:47
tell people to stop eating for a while,
6:49
and go drink a lot of water, and maybe have some vinegar.
6:52
So basically, kind of go on a cleanse,
6:54
and hopefully that'll help you.
6:56
But this idea of studying medicine systematically
6:58
goes all the way back to Greece, with guys like Hippocrates,
7:01
and a couple hundred years after that, a guy
7:03
by the name of Galen.
7:05
Art.
7:06
The fine arts-- especially Renaissance art--
7:09
is completely based on ancient Greece and Rome.
7:13
And so you can see these ancient Greek and Roman statues
7:15
over here of Venus or Aphrodite.
7:17
Right?
7:18
This is a very particular version
7:19
known as the Venus Pudica, where she's covering herself.
7:22
And we can see that exact same style used over here
7:25
in Botticelli's Birth of Venus.
7:30
Right?
7:30
And so we can see her rising on the half shell
7:33
there, covering herself just like these statues that
7:35
came 1,500 years earlier.
7:37
And this idea, kind of along with art, this idea of kind
7:39
of realism and idealism--
7:43
very much embodied in Greece.
7:45
Literature.
7:45
Right?
7:46
In order to understand a lot of literature
7:49
from kind of the Renaissance on, you
7:51
have to understand ancient Greek and Roman literature.
7:54
And even today in the modern world,
7:56
when we're looking at things like movies,
7:58
we get movies like-- if you've ever seen O Brother,
8:00
Where Art Thou?
8:01
This is set in a different place, in a different time,
8:03
but it exactly models the story of Homer's Odyssey.
8:08
And so to really appreciate much of literature
8:10
in the modern world, you got to understand
8:12
what's going on with literature in ancient Greece.
8:15
And then, saving the best for last,
8:18
of course we've got delicious wine.
8:21
Right?
8:21
And so winemaking-- maybe Greece isn't actually
8:24
the earliest culture to drink wine.
8:27
And if you want to know more about that,
8:29
take my humanities 150B1 class, mind-altering substances
8:34
in the ancient world, where we'll
8:35
talk a lot about the origins of wine
8:38
from not just Greece and Rome but from all
8:40
over the ancient world.
8:42
But Greece is-- it kind of plays a huge role in the Greek diet,
8:45
and it became a part of everyday life.
8:48
And today, it still is for many people.
Roman Republic
8:52
So let's move westward now, across the Mediterranean
8:54
to Rome, the legacy of Rome.
8:57
So just like we started with democracy for the Greeks, now
9:00
we move on to Roman Republicanism.
9:03
Right?
9:03
Again, perhaps nothing is more important than the idea
9:07
that people should share power in the way
9:10
that they're governed.
9:12
And with the Greek world, we saw this idea of direct democracy.
9:15
Everybody goes in and votes on an issue.
9:17
Over here in Rome, we have this idea of republicanism,
9:21
where we vote on officials to take office
9:25
and then the officials do the legislating.
9:27
And that's the core idea of Roman Republicanism.
9:29
And it's actually much, much closer to what we have.
9:32
Even though we call it a democracy today in America,
9:35
it's much, much closer to Roman Republicanism.
9:37
Now, Romans were able to build this enormous empire.
9:40
And a huge part of the reason they were able to do that
9:43
is because of their developments in engineering
9:45
and construction.
9:46
Now, so many buildings today--
9:48
I passed some on the way in to record this lecture--
9:52
are being made out of concrete right now.
9:55
And that development goes back to ancient Rome.
9:57
And when you see buildings like this--
9:59
this is the roof, the kind of dome of the Pantheon in Rome
10:04
that dates back 2,000 years.
10:06
It was the largest dome in the world for 1,500 years.
10:10
And the reason it can stand up is
10:11
because it's made of concrete.
10:13
The reason Rome is able to put ports and harbors all around
10:16
the Mediterranean is they developed the type of concrete
10:19
that will actually set underwater.
10:21
And so the use of these kind of everyday things like concrete
10:24
and vaults and arches and domes all goes back to ancient Rome.
Christianity
10:29
Christianity.
10:30
Right?
10:31
I was looking it up.
10:32
Something like there are 1.6 billion Christians in the world
10:35
today.
10:37
And that all goes back to Roman antiquity.
10:39
Right?
10:40
So Jesus is born under the emperor Augustus,
10:42
the very first emperor.
10:43
He dies under the emperor Tiberius, the second empire.
10:47
And then his followers over the next few hundred years
10:51
start to grow the religion.
10:53
And today, something like a little less than a third
10:56
of the world ends up being Christian.
10:59
And you can think about why that was an attractive religion back
11:02
in Roman antiquity.
11:04
In Rome, they don't have a super-developed idea
11:07
of the afterlife in traditional kind of Roman pagan religion.
11:11
And so the idea that, kind of, you
11:14
live life to the best in the life that you've got
11:17
is very appealing if you're a rich Roman.
11:19
Right?
11:20
Go ahead with your convivium.
11:21
Drink your wine and hang out and have fun
11:24
with your aristocratic friends.
11:26
But if you're at the lower end of the spectrum,
11:29
it's far less appealing.
11:31
And so something like Christianity that says,
11:33
hey, don't worry about how crappy your life is right now.
11:37
Worry about something beyond, after you die.
11:41
That's where you'll be rewarded.
11:43
That ends up being very, very appealing
11:45
to a kind of marginalized segment of the population.
11:48
And 2,000 years later, it's a third
11:50
of the world's population.
11:52
The Latin language.
11:53
Right?
11:54
So if you are writing anything down,
11:56
if you're taking notes right now,
11:57
you are most likely doing so not using the Greek alphabet
12:01
but using the Latin script.
12:04
And so we still use the Latin script today.
12:06
And again, the idea of a script is that you
12:08
can write any language in it.
12:10
Right?
12:10
So you could write Spanish or English or German or Latin
12:16
all in the Latin script.
12:17
Right?
12:17
Using Latin letters, you can write a diversity of languages.
12:21
But Latin itself ends up contributing to English
12:25
in a particular sort of way.
12:26
Something like 60% of the words that we've got in English
12:30
go back to Latin roots.
12:32
So not only do we use the script, most of our words
12:35
today have Latin roots as well.
12:37
The idea of codified law.
12:39
Right?
12:39
Now this sounds really boring.
12:41
Right?
12:41
OK.
12:41
So they wrote some laws down.
12:42
What's the big deal?
12:44
Well, the big deal is once you write laws down,
12:46
everybody has to play by the same rules.
12:49
You can't have your aristocratic friends say, oh yeah, well,
12:52
don't worry about that.
12:53
Right?
12:54
Because the laws are now written in stone or bronze
12:58
or on a computer, whatever it may be.
13:00
Right?
13:02
The idea that laws are codified means everybody plays
13:04
by the same rules.
13:06
And this is really important for the development of equality
13:09
within a society.
13:11
Architecture.
13:12
So what we're looking at here-- we are looking at the Pantheon
13:15
in Rome on the left hand side, dating back originally
13:19
to Marcus Agrippa-- that's whose name is up there--
13:21
but then rebuilt by Hadrian in the second century AD.
13:24
It's this super weird kind of temple
13:26
where it's like rectilinear on the front
13:28
and then cylindrical on the back.
13:30
And for 1,500 years, it has the largest dome in the world.
13:33
And we're not looking at a model of the Pantheon over here
13:35
on the right.
13:36
What we're looking at is--
13:37
take a guess.
13:39
That's right.
13:39
It's the Jefferson Memorial.
13:40
Right?
13:41
So in Washington, DC, the Jefferson Memorial
13:43
is directly modeled on the Pantheon.
13:46
And so just like we saw with the US Treasury and something
13:51
like the Hephaisteion in the Athenian Agora,
13:53
we see all the same kind of elements.
13:55
Capitals and a dome.
13:57
This kind of podium over here.
14:00
The idea that you have the rectilinear front and that
14:02
cylindrical back.
14:04
A lot of influence from ancient Roman architecture
14:06
shows up today, especially in neoclassical architecture.
14:10
Infrastructure.
14:11
Right?
14:11
You've heard all roads lead to Rome.
14:14
Right?
14:15
And so Romans were known for building these elaborate road
14:18
networks.
14:18
And one of the coolest things is you can still
14:20
go walk on them today.
14:21
Right?
14:22
You can see here the old cart marks,
14:24
that would have been driven by donkeys or horses or whatever.
14:27
You can see they've worn their way into this ancient Roman
14:30
road.
14:30
And you, too, can go outside the walls of Rome
14:33
and go walking down the Via Appia.
14:36
And this idea-- roads are a huge part
14:38
of the way that we get around.
14:39
And along with sewage systems and aqueducts and ports
14:42
and harbors, this idea of a fundamentally strong
14:45
infrastructure is very much a part
14:48
of the ancient Roman world.
14:49
Sport and spectacle.
14:50
We looked at sport with the ancient Greek world.
14:52
And we looked at things like the Olympics.
14:54
And we often associate sport with ancient Greece
14:57
because it's more about the athletic competition itself.
15:00
We often associate spectacle with ancient Rome
15:03
because it's about the crowds.
15:05
Right?
15:06
In a way that is kind above and beyond what was going on
15:10
in the Greek world, you get crowds involved with Rome
15:13
at the gladiatorial games and in the circuses.
15:17
So the Colosseum held something like 50,000 people.
15:20
Right?
15:20
It's about the size of a college football stadium today.
15:23
And they were all there to cheer on their favorite gladiator
15:27
or their favorite chariot racing team.
15:30
And so it became something more than just kind
15:32
of participating in a sport for the athletic kind
15:35
of competition and the kind of health benefits.
15:39
It became a place to go be social, to be, to be seen,
15:43
and to see people and to meet people,
15:46
and to interact with one another.
15:48
The military.
15:49
Right?
15:50
The idea of a professional military goes back to Rome.
15:54
All right?
15:54
And so we got a military today where you can sign up for it
15:56
and that's your job.
15:57
Right?
15:58
You get paid to do it.
16:00
You get benefits afterwards.
16:01
Right?
16:02
Whether that's education or retirement benefits,
16:04
something like that.
16:05
This idea goes back to Rome.
16:07
And it wasn't always like that.
16:09
In the early days of Rome, the idea
16:11
was that only citizens from the city could be--
16:15
citizens of Rome could be part of the military.
16:17
And you had to have land and be able to equip yourself
16:20
with the weapons and armor necessary.
16:22
But later, under Marius, we see him professionalize the army,
16:26
say that the government will pay for your armor and weapons,
16:30
that you don't have to have land,
16:32
that you'll get an annual salary,
16:34
and that if you serve a certain amount of time
16:36
you're going to get some land when you retire.
16:39
All right?
16:40
And so that idea of the Army as a full time job
16:43
rather than a citizen militia that rises up when called upon
16:47
is something that goes back to the Roman civilization.
16:50
And then finally, once again the most important thing--
16:53
wine.
16:53
Right?
16:54
And if the Greeks liked their wine,
16:56
the Romans liked it even more.
16:58
And so in the Roman world, you've
16:59
got all these different varietals.
17:01
Right?
17:01
So you've got your regular wine, you've got this Egyptian wine.
17:04
They mixed it with honey and other weird kind of things.
17:07
Falernian wine, that was like the highest level of wine.
17:10
It was very expensive in the ancient Roman world.
17:12
That's what the emperors drank.
17:14
And it became kind of so popular that people in the Roman world
17:18
are drinking something like a liter of wine
17:20
per person per day.
17:22
So you should probably not do that.
17:24
That's a little bit overkill.
17:26
But Rome definitely influenced us
17:28
in making this a very kind of popular beverage.
Conclusion
17:33
So a few concluding thoughts.
17:37
There are a lot of different reasons
17:38
to study classical antiquity.
17:40
Right?
17:41
And one of the main ones is if you don't study it,
17:43
you're going to be doomed to repeat
17:46
the mistakes of the past.
17:48
But one of the big reasons is that ancient Greece
17:51
and ancient Rome have a huge influence.
17:53
Right?
17:54
You can look at the Senate floor in ancient Rome,
17:56
you can look at the Senate floor in modern America.
18:00
One of the huge reasons is that both Greece and Rome
18:04
have played an incredible role in developing American society
18:09
throughout our history, but especially in the 21st century.
18:14
And that's what we might call the classical legacy.
