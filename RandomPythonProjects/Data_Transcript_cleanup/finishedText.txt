  0:05  Hello and welcome to today's lecture  on explaining the Roman Empire.  I'm professor Dr. Rob Stephan, and today we're  going to ask that question of why was the Roman Empire so  successful for so long?  What was it about it that made this thing work?  So we're going to go ahead and start by setting the scene,  figuring out how we got at this point in time.  Then we're going to go ahead, recap our story from civil war  to Roman peace, and then we're going  to take a look at 10 reasons why the Roman Empire succeeded.  And then we'll wrap up with some concluding thoughts.  So let's go ahead and set the scene.  Our story of course starts long before the city of Rome  was ever founded when the Italian peninsula was comprised  of a diversity of tribes, the most powerful and successful  of which were the Etruscans.  In 753 BC, Rome was founded by Romulus,  and for the next 250 years it was ruled  by a series of seven kings.  And while they started out really good,  they ended not so good.  And that's when Lucius Junius Brutus in 509 BC  started a rebellion against those kings  kicking Tarquin the Proud out of Rome  and starting the Roman Republic.  In the prevailing ideology of the Roman  Republic is there are no kings in Rome.  There is always shared power.  At least two people rule at the highest position  and they are voted in by the regular people.  Now it turns out that after 500 years  that doesn't work out so well, because the people competing  for those positions and that prestige  end up using Roman armies to fight other Romans  and we're embroiled in a series of one hundred years  worth of civil war.  Now Octavian is able to come out of that victorious  and eventually work out an agreement with the Roman Senate  where he basically restores the public symbolically,  but practically they give him sole power.  And that's when we start the era known as the Roman Empire.  So let's go ahead and take, kind of,  a slightly more in-depth look at how we get from civil war  to Roman peace.  So the Civil Wars start with this conflict between Marius  CIVIL WARS PARTI: MARIUS VS SULLA  and Sulla, and Marius is the hero  of the populares, the everyday people,  while Sulla is the hero of the optimates  or the senatorial class.  And so these guys are the first ones  to take Roman armies and marched on the city of Rome, all right.  So when Marius gets control, Sulla  takes his army and marches on the city.  Marius has to get out.  And then when Sulla leaves to go fight Mithridates,  Marius takes his army and marches back  on the City of Rome.  And then later on, after defeating Mithridates,  Sulla marches back on the city of Rome  and kills like 50,000 supporters of Marius.  Now even though they kind of have  these in particular battles, nobody ever really ultimately  wins.  And so we see this same conflict played out again decades later  between Julius Caesar, the hero of the populares and Pompey  the Great, one of Rome's greatest military heroes.  And he actually goes back and forth quite a bit.  He starts out as kind of a pro-Sullen optimate,  he eventually moves to be one of these pro-propulares leaders  teaming up with Caesar but then eventually moves back  towards the senatorial side of things.  And they end up fighting it out at [? Farceless ?] in 48  CIVIL WARS PART II: CAESAR VS POMPEY  BC where Caesar's able to win.  But even with that victory, that doesn't settle anything  in the long run.  And so we see this play out again a decade or so later,  a little less than a decade later between Octavian,  Caesar's adopted heir, and Marc Anthony, Caesar's main general.  An after they team up and dispatch the senators  at the Battle of Philippi in 42, they  end up fighting each other at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.  So when they defeat the senators,  the Second Triumvirate breaks up the Roman world  TRIUMVIRS DIVIDE ROME'S TERRITORY  into three parts.  Octavian gets the west, Antony gets the east,  and Lepidus gets a little bit in North Africa.  Nobody cares about Lepidus But in this series  of battles after defeating Lepidus in 36 and Antony in 31,  Octavian ends up taking sole control of the Roman world.  OCTAVIAN CONTROLS ALL OF ROMAN WORLD  So now he's got the west and Octavian's got  the east and Octavia's got North Africa.  He's got the entire Roman world at this point in time.  Now Octavian eventually works out  of that agreement with the Senate given the title of print  caps the first citizen and Augustus the revered one,  ROMAN WORLD AT THE DEATH OF AUGUSTUS 14 CE  and so he takes that.  Augustus makes it part of his name,  so we'll refer to him as Augustus from here on out.  And at his death in 14 after ruling for 41 years,  this is what the Roman Empire looks like.  After the death of the first empire,  it's just about as large as it's going to get.  And we can see it 100 years later now,  kind of, at its peak, right, and it's more or less the same.  Again, this is under Augustus.  This is 100 years later--  a little bit more territory but really just fighting around  the edges of empire.  So let's go ahead now and take a look at 10 reasons  why the Roman Empire was successful.  Why does this whole thing work?  And it's an interesting question to ask, because when we looked  at Greece and we looked at the Athenian empire  in the 5th century BC that only lasts for maybe 50 years.  It's a relatively short period of time.  Now Greek culture lasts a lot longer than that,  but their ability to kind of dominate other areas  is really quite short.  So Rome ends up going from 27 BC all the way for another 500  years, and you could even look kind of previously  to that starting with the Punic wars as, kind of, Rome's  empire starting back then.  So it really ends up being quite a long time.  Now the first reason that Rome, kind of, is so successful,  right-- this is probably what you were thinking of.  THE ROMAN ARMY  This is an obvious one--  the Roman army, right.  They're really strong.  They're very well-organized.  And this deters invasion from the outside,  and it also deters rebellion from the inside.  And one of the things that they do when they structure the army  is when you get soldiers from particular regions,  the Romans don't let those soldiers  serve in their home land, OK.  So if you're a soldier from Britain  and you join the Roman army, you're  going to be stationed somewhere other than Britain.  And what that does is it, kind, of prevents you  from teaming up with people in that region  to foment rebellion.  Now the second reason we're going to look at  EXTERNAL ENEMIES SMALL IN SCALE  are Rome's external enemies, and they turn out  to be kind of fairly small in scale.  Now during the whole Pax Romana, right,  during the whole Roman Empire, there's  always fighting around the edge.  When we say the Roman peace or the Pax Romana,  it doesn't mean there's no fighting at all.  It just means things internally are very peaceful.  There's always still fighting around the edge,  but it turns out that this doesn't matter a lot.  Maybe you gain a little bit of land.  Maybe you lose a little bit of land.  But the enemies aren't strong enough  to make any kind of serious impact into Roman cohesion.  Now how do you rule these areas?  EXTREMELY LIGHT BUREAUCRACY  Well, one of the reasons Rome's successful  is that it has a very light bureaucracy.  And what I mean by that is they're  able to govern an extremely large area of land  with a very small number of administrators.  And so it's something like several hundred administrators  to govern the entire Roman Empire.  And that might sound like a lot.  That's an incredibly small number of administrators  to govern an area this large.  You could compare this with something like Hon China.  So Hon China is an empire around the same time as Rome  over in the east obviously, and they  have something like 50 times as many administrators  as Rome does-- a very different way of doing things.  TRICKLE DOWN ASSIMILIATION  So if they have this few administrators, right,  if they have this small number of administrators,  how does it actually work that they  can govern such a large area?  Well, that comes to the fourth reason,  and that's the strategy of trickle down assimilation,  all right.  So if you go all over the Roman world--  these pictures are from Croatia and you have this fine looking  professor here in front of these very Roman looking monuments  in Croatia, right--  how does it get there?  How do you rule places like that if you're  just, kind of, centered on the Italian peninsula?  Well, what you do is you co-opt local leaders.  So here we see Vercingetorix, and he obviously  didn't get co-opted.  But the idea is you take other Gallic leaders  and other leaders from Croatia in all  of these areas around the Roman Empire,  and you basically incentivize them.  You flip that guy at the top, and you make it really  worth their while to convert other people to this,  kind of, Roman way of living.  And then you only have to reward one person.  And in doing so, you don't need to set up your own people  there.  You can rely on this person to keep them, kind of, at bay,  keep them Romanized, that, sort of,  thing without a lot of people up at the top.  ACCEPTING OF FOREIGN INFLUENCE  In addition to that, Rome is very  accepting in general about, kind of,  religious and cultural influence.  So they want people to, kind of, be Romanized, right.  That's useful for them.  But at the same time, when it comes to religion  and comes to, kind of, cultural beliefs.  They're extremely open.  And with religion especially, they're  actually willing to bringing gods from abroad.  So what we're looking at here is Niforos, all right,  and he's this God from the east.  Think about almost the old Persian Empire or something  like that.  And when the Roman armies go out east, they encounter, kind of,  this God, and they're like that guy's cool.  We like what he's doing, what he's bringing to the table  religiously, and so they bring him back to Rome  and they set up a cult for him in Rome.  And Rome is basically fine with this.  The more gods, the better.  They have the traditional pantheon.  But if you like some other god, that's just fine.  And so that allows them to incorporate  a huge diversity of people and not upset their core beliefs.  And as long as they pay taxes and as long as they, kind of,  worship the Roman Empire as well,  right, then they're all good.  And remember it's that last thing that ends up  getting Christians in trouble--  their kind of inability or unwillingness  to worship the emperor because they  think Jesus is the only person to be worshipped there.  So the sixth reason-- this is very, very practical, right--  TAXES WERE RELATIVELY LOW KET A GOOD FOR ECONOMYA  taxes in the Roman Empire were very low.  Right now think about how much you pay in taxes, right,  if you know.  I always ask that question to students,  and they always think, like, I don't know,  the answer is 10% or something.  We pay way more than that in taxes.  But in the ancient Roman Empire, it was only about 5% to 10%  of somebody's income that they would end up paying.  And so you had to pay your taxes,  but it was a fairly light burden.  Today we pay 25% or 30% or more of our income in taxes.  Now taxation also the argument has  been that it's been good for the economy.  And the reason for this is what this does  is when you have to pay somebody in coin,  you have to go to the market to sell your goods.  So even if you're a farmer like way  out growing your crops, growing grain or grapes or olive oil,  right, you can't just trade that for other stuff you need.  You have to go to a market.  You have to sell it there, so that you can get coinage  so that you can pay your taxes.  And this basically brings people together in markets  and facilitates a greater level of exchange.  COMMON CURRENCY  And this goes along with our seventh reason that Rome's  successful, a common currency.  So we saw with Augustus that one of the things he does  is he links the kind of Roman mint  with the provincial mint basically making,  kind of, an empire wide economy.  And what this does is it allows for really easy commerce  across huge distances.  You can go ahead and be an Egyptian dude who sales out  to France, gives them a bunch of coins  to buy a bunch of delicious French wine,  and then sales back to Egypt, and, A,  you've got ports in both places and, B,  you can pay with your coinage and they're  going to know that it's good coinage, all right.  So it lowers these transaction costs,  and it facilitates large scale long distance trade.  EXCELLENT INFRASTRUCTURE  Now one of the other reasons you're able to get from Egypt  all away to France for your nice delicious wine  is the wonderful Roman infrastructure,  reason number eight.  So Rome is known for its roads, right.  All the roads lead to Rome, and we can still  see those in the archaeological record today.  So this is the Via Appia running out of Rome to Brundisium.  And once you get, kind of, just outside the city,  you can walk along this thing.  It's a really cool experience to walk all along a road that  was built 2000 years ago.  And if you're looking closely, you  can actually still see where the, kind of,  cart marks are in the original stones, right.  So where the carts would go, you get  these kind of divots in the original stones.  And that along with harbors and ports and that sort of thing  helps people move themselves and goods quickly and cheaply  across the empire.  Now another form of infrastructure  CLEAN WATER  is reason number nine, and that's the aqueducts.  The only reason Rome is able to be a city of a million people  is because they have clean water, all right.  In the ancient world, you get these large cities  and they're like hotbeds of disease, all right.  The only reason that that's, kind of, kept at bay  is because people had good clean drinking water, and the reason  they have that is because they build this enormous, kind of,  amazing system of aqueducts leading from these,  kind of, mountains where you get runoff, the water runoff,  and then it's at something like a slope of, like, less than 1%  over dozens of miles, right.  It's just sloped just that much, and it ends up in Rome  and everybody has access to clean water  to keep them healthy and keep them hydrated.  And then we turn to reason number 10, right, perhaps  the biggest reason of all, and we've mentioned  this a little bit already.  IMPERIAL RULE  One of the biggest reasons that this ends up working,  the empire ends up working is because Rome stops fighting  with each other, right.  The Senate and the people of Rome  are able to get behind a single person.  And so we see that even though the republic had  some wonderful leaders, people far more  intelligent than the later Giulio Claudians, right--  Julius Caesar was brilliant.  Caligula was crazy, and yet Caligula  is ruling an empire where everything's  nice and smooth and peaceful, and Julius Caesar  ends up assassinated on the Ides of March.  So people in the Senate's ability  to get behind a single person is a huge part of what this,  kind of--  what makes this peace last, right,  the kind of general agreement not to fight with each other.  So let's wrap up with a couple concluding thoughts.  So we've got all these reasons, right, the Roman army, we've  got weak external enemies, we've got  CONCLUDING THOUGHTS  this very light bureaucracy, and trickle down assimilation  that helps convert people over to the Romanized  way of doing things.  We've got a culture that's very accepting of other cultures  religiously and otherwise.  We've got low taxes, right-- everybody loves that--  a common currency, which facilitates exchange.  We've got excellent infrastructure.  People can move all over the place in the Roman world,  and they can drink clean water and stay healthy  in highly urbanized cities.  And then finally, right, by kind of accepting this, kind of,  one person as ruler, they stop fighting  with each other, which allows for this period of peace.  And this, kind of--  it raises a question to me, right,  as I was putting this together.  I was thinking, which is better?  Is it better to have the rule of the people  where people get to vote on kind of meaningful leaders  like you have in the Republic but have that lead to,  kind of, chaos, right, civil war,  or is it better to have that power, kind of,  taken away, right?  People aren't meaningfully voting anymore,  and yet the world is at peace and things  are going really well.  So I don't think that there's a particularly right or wrong  answer to that, but it's an interesting question to ask  and one that must be asked if you're trying  to explain the Roman Empire.  16:15  [SOUND]
